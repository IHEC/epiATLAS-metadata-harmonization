# Version 1.0
The CSV for the metadata can be found at [IHEC_metadata_harmonization.v1.0.csv](IHEC_metadata_harmonization.v1.0.csv).

## News
- The prefix `harm` has been renamed to `harmonized` for all columns where at least one cell was changed compared to the original data from EpiRR.
- The prefix `automated` was added afterwards for all columns that are genereated completely automatically and lack manual curation. They are available in the extended version only.
- The column originally called `line` has been renamed to `cell_line`, i.e. now `harmonized_cell_line`.
- The column originally called `markers` has been renamed to `cell_markers`, i.e. now `harmonized_cell_markers`.
- In all columns originally containing `disease` it has been renamed to `sample_disease`, to emphasize that this attribute reflects **the disease for this particular sample**, not the donor health condition..

## Diff
The overall diff between v0.10 and v0.11 can be found at [diff_v0.11_v1.0.json](diff_v0.11_v1.0.json)

## Extended Version:
For more information on the columns from the **extended version** at [IHEC_metadata_harmonization.v1.0.extended.csv](IHEC_metadata_harmonization.v1.0.extended.csv), please also see [version 0.9](https://github.com/IHEC/epimap-metadata-harmonization/releases/tag/v0.9).

## Metadata Standard
Please keep in mind that we try to stay as close to
the [IHEC Metadata Standard](https://github.com/IHEC/ihec-ecosystems/blob/master/docs/metadata/2.0/Ihec_metadata_specification.md)
as possible.
