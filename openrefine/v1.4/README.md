# Version 1.4

This repository is only for **sample metadata**, _not experiment metadata_.
For more information about experiment metadata check out the [IHEC Data Portal](https://epigenomesportal.ca/) and [EpiATLAS](https://ihec-epigenomes.org/epiatlas/data/).
You can also find a summary of this sample metadata on [EpiRR](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/epirr/).
The current version of the sample metadata contains **2279 EpiRR entries**. This is the number of entries for which reprocessed data is available.
Two versions of the sample metadata are available, the CSV for the **core** sample metadata containing 8 fields can be found at [openrefine/v1.4/IHEC_sample_metadata_harmonization.v1.4.csv](IHEC_sample_metadata_harmonization.v1.4.csv) and the **extended** version containing 54 fields at [openrefine/v1.4/IHEC_sample_metadata_harmonization.v1.4_extended.csv](IHEC_sample_metadata_harmonization.v1.4_extended.csv)

## News

- The `harmonized_donor_life_stage` was reverted to `unknown` for 55 entries.

## Raw Files

In case you are interested in the raw files that the harmonization process was based on, those can be found at [raw/EpiAtlas_EpiRR_metadata_all.csv](https://github.com/IHEC/epiATLAS-metadata-harmonization/blob/0fb3cebdab7dcf7bd0f9b0b7195e867539248a15/raw/EpiAtlas_EpiRR_metadata_all.csv).
Note that they contain different column names, as they changed during the harmonization process.

## Diff

The overall diff between v1.3 and v1.4 can be found at [openrefine/v1.4/diff_v1.3_v1.4.json](diff_v1.3_v1.4.json)

## Metadata Standard

Please keep in mind that we try to stay as close to the [IHEC Metadata Standard](https://github.com/IHEC/ihec-ecosystems/blob/master/docs/metadata/2.0/Ihec_metadata_specification.md) as possible.

## Column descriptions:
