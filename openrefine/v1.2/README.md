# Version 1.2

At this time, this repository is only for **sample metadata**, _not experiment metadata_.
There is metadata available for **2279 EpiRR entries**.
The CSV for the sample metadata can be found
at [openrefine/v1.2/IHEC_metadata_harmonization.v1.2.csv](https://github.com/IHEC/epiATLAS-metadata-harmonization/blob/main/openrefine/v1.2/IHEC_metadata_harmonization.v1.2.csv)
and the extended version
at  [openrefine/v1.2/IHEC_metadata_harmonization.v1.2.extended.csv](https://github.com/IHEC/epiATLAS-metadata-harmonization/blob/main/openrefine/v1.2/IHEC_metadata_harmonization.v1.2.extended.csv)

## News

- Added 63 entries that had erroneously been removed in v1.1.
- The columns `harmonized_donor_sex` and `harmonized_donor_life_stage` have been complemented and corrected, based on
  the prediction of the EpiClass tool. For more information on this, please contact Pierre-Ã‰tienne Jacques.
- Some minor changes to `sample_disease` and `donor_health_status` columns.
- Added column `epiATLAS_status` which is equivalent to `harmonized_EpiRR_status` but referring to the reprocessed data
  rather than original submitted data, describing the status of the reference epigenome with the additional information
  of full epigenomes when using imputed data.
- **Extended version:** Added columns for each assay type (histone marks, wgbs, and
  rna-seq) `automated_experiments_${assay}` containing the uuid for observed data, or `imputed` if only imputed data is
  available.
- **Extended version:** Added column `harmonized_sample_ontology_term_high_order_fig1`
- **Extended version:** Columns `sample_ontology_term_high_order_JeffreyHyacinthe`
  and `sample_ontology_term_high_order_JonathanSteif` have been removed and replaced
  by `harmonized_sample_ontology_term_high_order_fig1` containing the sample labels corresponding to the annotations in
  the overview figure.
- **Extended version:** Added columns `harmonized_sample_[...]_order_AnetaMikulasova` containing manually assigned
  labels by Aneta
  Mikulasova, which contain information about organ, cell, and cancer (sub-)types.
- **Extended version:** Removed columns `automated_harmonized_($column)_($order)(_unique)?`,
  e.g., `automated_harmonized_sample_ontology_term_intermediate_order_unique` containing the automatic extraction higher
  order as decribed in [v0.9](https://github.com/IHEC/epiATLAS-metadata-harmonization/releases/tag/v0.9). These columns
  were used to derive the `harmonized_sample_ontology_intermediate` and `harmonized_sample_disease_intermediate`
  columns, but this was based on older versions of these columns. The columns are still generated internally, for
  checking purposes, but could confuse users and are not necessary for the metadata.

## Diff

## Metadata Standard

Please keep in mind that we try to stay as close to
the [IHEC Metadata Standard](https://github.com/IHEC/ihec-ecosystems/blob/master/docs/metadata/2.0/Ihec_metadata_specification.md)
as possible.
